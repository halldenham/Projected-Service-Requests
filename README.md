# Projected-Service-Requests

These files are a simple way to calculate the amount of work anticipated over a two week span for a facility maintenance program.
The projected work is based on taking known and existing (preventive maintenance) work and estimated FTE's required, and also
looking at historical data from unknown (service request) work and using the historical data as an estimate for work that will be
recieved over the next two weeks, or given period of time.
